# Weather-App
A simple web application created using node.js and express.js to get the weather information for any city. 

This code is a Node.js express web application that receives a city name from an HTML form, makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap to get weather information for that city, and returns the current temperature and description of the weather along with an image to the user in a browser.

This code was created during the web development course I'm enrolled in. It was created in a simple way, without styling, just to show the back end of the application.
